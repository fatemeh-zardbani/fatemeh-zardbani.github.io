I am a Senior Research Engineer at Huawei R&D and a recent PhD graduate in Computer Science, specializing in adaptive indexing, large-scale vector search, and multimodal retrieval systems. My work focuses on designing high-performance infrastructure for modern AI systems, including ANN indexing, cross-modal embedding spaces, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and graph-based knowledge retrieval. I have built production-grade ML systems spanning hardware-agnostic parallel frameworks, custom DSLs, and self-tuning storage engines, and have conducted research at institutions including Harvard University and Aarhus University. My academic work has been published at top venues such as VLDB, ICDE, and EDBT, with contributions in adaptive indexing and high-dimensional clustering. I am passionate about bridging research and real-world systems, building scalable, low-latency infrastructure that powers next-generation AI applications.

During my 6+ years of combined industrial and academic experience, I have worked 
with/on;
- Adaptive indexing for spatial and metric data.
- High-dimensional clustering and benchmarking.
- Incremental maintenance of multi-dimensional data structures.
 - Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV)
 - Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLM)
  - Python, Java, C/C++
 - Tensorflow, PyTorch, SQL
 - Git, Docker
